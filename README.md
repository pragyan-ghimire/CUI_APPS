# CUI_APPS
I have created simple CUI JAVA apps (Word Counter and Teacher Database) in Eclipse IDE.

### Word Counter
Created WordCounter class. Run, asks user to "Write a sentence or paragragh". Scanner class nextLine() method is used to get user input and charAt(index) is used to
 count number of spaces in sentence or paragraph.
 
 ### Teacher Database
 Created TeacherDatabaseApp and Teacher classes. The TeacherDatabaseApp class has main method which contains authentication code.After authenticating, it prints 
 "Access Granted" if user is verified or "Access Denied". When user is verified it asks user to "Enter number of records to be added", then calls default constructor
 of Teacher class. Teacher class contains methods to handle further process...
 #### Teacher()
  #### setAge() 
  #### setId()  
  #### setContact()
  #### teacherFaculty()
  #### show()
